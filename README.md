# Crossterm Utilities

**The `crossterm_utils` crate is deprecated and longer maintained. The GitHub repository will
be archived soon. All the code is being moved to the `crossterm` crate. You can learn more in
the [Merge sub-crates to the crossterm crate](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm/issues/265)
issue.**

An utilities crate used by the following [crossterm](https://crates.io/crates/crossterm) modules:

- [crossterm_style](https://crates.io/crates/crossterm_style) 
- [crossterm_input](https://crates.io/crates/crossterm_input) 
- [crossterm_screen](https://crates.io/crates/crossterm_screen)
- [crossterm_cursor](https://crates.io/crates/crossterm_cursor)
- [crossterm_terminal](https://crates.io/crates/crossterm_terminal)

This crate is **not meant for standalone use** and is really just a library with some common used
code for the [`crossterm`](https://crates.io/crates/crossterm) crate and the above named modules.

This crate will be deprecated soon and no longer maintained. It's highly recommended
to not use it.
